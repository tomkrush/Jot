# Jot

Overview
----------
What is Jot? Jot is a CodeIgniter Active Record solution developed specifically for people who want to make kick-ass web applications. Jot is influenced after Active Record from Ruby on Rails and Core Data from Cocoa. Why is Jot different from other ORM's in PHP. Jot is designed for the PHP syntax. It doesn't use clever magic to create an illusion that PHP is non-existant. PHP is a beautiful language and Jot proves it.
